Web Scraper for Book Titles on Books to Scrape
=====================================================
Project Overview
---------------
This project is a Python-based web scraper designed to extract book titles from the website Books to Scrape. The scraper navigates through the paginated catalog of books and collects all the titles into a CSV file.

Requirements
------------
Python 3.x
Required libraries:
requests: To send HTTP requests and fetch webpage content.
BeautifulSoup (from bs4): To parse and navigate the HTML structure of the webpages.
pandas: To store and manage the extracted data in a structured format, and save it to a CSV file.

How It Works
-------------
Initialization: The script initializes an empty list (all_headings) to store the titles of books.

Pagination Loop: The script uses a while loop to iterate through the paginated pages of the book catalog on the website.

Requesting the Page: For each page, an HTTP GET request is made to fetch the HTML content.

Parsing the Content: The HTML content is parsed using BeautifulSoup with the lxml parser.

Extracting Titles: All book titles (contained within <h3> tags) are extracted and appended to the all_headings list.

Breaking the Loop: If a non-200 status code is encountered, the loop is terminated, indicating that there are no more pages to scrape.

Saving Data: After all pages have been scraped, the collected book titles are saved into a CSV file (headings.csv) using Pandas.

Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling to manage potential HTTP request issues.

Usage
-----
To run the script, execute it in a Python environment. The script will:

Scrape book titles from all available pages on the Books to Scrape website.
Save the titles to a CSV file named headings.csv.

Notes
-----
Rate Limiting: The script includes a time.sleep(2) delay between page requests to prevent overloading the server.

Headers: The script does not include custom headers but can be easily modified to include them if necessary to mimic a browser request.

Potential Improvements
---------------------
Additional Data: The scraper can be extended to collect additional data, such as book prices, availability, and ratings.

Error Handling: More sophisticated error handling could be added, such as retries for failed requests.

Parallel Scraping: For larger datasets, parallel scraping techniques could be employed to speed up the process.
